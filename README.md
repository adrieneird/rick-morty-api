# Rick & Morty Vue3 API Characters

This project embraces KISS philosophy.
Instead of using axios, it uses a simple fetch().

Could've used localStorage instead of store for simpler stuff (currentPage & search).

Can be improved by :
- Not cleaning the store at each search
- Store images as base64 instead of relying on browser cache
